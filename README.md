#### Do not send me spam.
#### I'm surprised I even have to say this, but if you have an issue with my code because I made a mistake that probably isn't even that big of a deal, just tell me how to improve it or make a pull request. If you don't want to do either and you'd rather harass me online, then don't bother annoying me.
