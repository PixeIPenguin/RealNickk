Hello, looks like you're curious about who I am. There's not much to know about me, but I'll tell you a few things:
- I'm 15 years old, and I'm in high school.    
- I am learning Russian, slowly but surely.    
- I am a self-taught programmer (However, I took standard JavaScript classes in 9th grade)     
- I am currently studying malware analysis and Windows internals.    
- I joined GitHub in the beginning of 2020.    

Languages I know:
- C/C++
- JavaScript
- Lua/Luau
- C#
- Pseudo-Intel Assembly

Social Highlights:
- People find me very terse and straightforward.    
- I don't like small talk unless I know you.

I'm available for help but I am not your slave. I will not feed you code with a spoon, because you don't learn anything by pasting code. I support using and looking at other people's work, as long as you follow their license guidelines and credit them. If you're going to waste my time, I won't talk to you.
