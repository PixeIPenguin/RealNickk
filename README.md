Highlights:
- I'm 15 years old, and I'm a tenth grader in high school.     
- I am a self-taught programmer, and I have a passion for it.
- I enjoy technology and in the next few years, I plan to go to college, majoring in the tech field.
- I joined GitHub in the beginning of 2020.    
- People find me very terse and straightforward, which makes me focused when I need to be so I don't end up wasting time.    
- I generally don't enjoy having small talk unless I know the person really well, which means that I'd have to be talking with you for a couple of days to get used to talking to you.
- I used to struggle a lot but I've improved socially, and even if I lost a lot of my friends, and I'm greatful for it.
- I will not spoonfeed you code, because you don't learn anything by pasting code. I support using and looking at other people's work, as long as you follow their license guidelines and credit them. If you want to learn by pasting or if you're going to waste my time, I won't talk to you.
