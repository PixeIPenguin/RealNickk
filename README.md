# H3x0R
Looks like you found meâ€”whoever you are. Let me tell you some things about me.    
- I'm currently going through high school.
- I am a self-taught programmer that focuses mainly on frontend development.    
- I enjoy game exploiting and generic reverse engineering.    
- I am a pretty straightforward person, but I struggle communicating face to face.    
- I joined GitHub in the beginning of 2020.
